While you are browsing the web, including this nice little website, a lot of assiduous little guys are doing all the work for you. You may have heard of them. They're called »bits« and deserve some gratitude.

This and the fact, that I wanted to see how these [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) thing works (btw, it does well), led me to create a place where you can increase your digital karma and give love back to our binary friends.
So go and [adopt one or two bits](http://adoptabit.heroku.com/). They'll be very happy!
