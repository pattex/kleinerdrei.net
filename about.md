# Arne Eilermann

I'm a Ruby programmer from Köln, Germany. Since 2008 I am working for the
[prometheus image archive](http://prometheus-bildarchiv.de/), which is located
at the Institute of Art History at the University of Köln. If you really want to
know more, you maybe want to taste the [soup I made](http://pattex.soup.io/).
